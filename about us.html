our bakery
We belong to a magnificent generation, with great challenges, we knew how to reinvest ourselves and adapt to the changes of the 21st century. That is the example that the first baker in the family gave us, Don Pablo Samuelle, as a Galician immigrant and Rosa's father, he grew and learned with great dedication, an example that together with Héctor we managed to continue imposing ourselves firmly in this century that we use until today. last corner of the earth, with an unimaginable pandemic.  Currently, with the imprint of our daughter, María Victoria, we continue to develop new products, adapted to new cultural and nutritional demands. We want to continue the story, since in our family we are transmitting this passion to the fourth generation.
